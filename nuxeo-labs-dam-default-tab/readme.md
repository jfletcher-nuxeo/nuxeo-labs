# Description
This simple bundle overrides the default startup helper to select the DAM view by default when a user connects to the application

### IMPORTANT
This plug-in is not included in `nuxeo-labs` Marketplace Package (because we don't want to always start in DAM): You must install it manually, probably in the `bundles` folder of `nxserver`.
