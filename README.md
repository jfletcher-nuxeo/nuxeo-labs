# Nuxeo Labs
===

The Nuxeo Solution Architects team is constantly producing prototype solutions for our current and future customers. From time to time customers have a problem that is not solved by the core Nuxeo platform, so we build a custom solution to solve it. [Nuxeo Labs](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-labs) contains those custom solutions we feel may enjoy usage by a wider audience.

## Build

Assuming [maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (3.2.1) is installed on your system, after downloading the whole repository, execute the following:

```
cd /path/to/nuxeo-labs
mvn install
```

The MP is in `nuxeo-labs-mp/target`, named `nuxeo-labs-mp-{version}.zip`. It can be [installed from the Admin Center](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/ADMINDOC/Installing+a+new+package+on+your+instance#InstallingaNewPackageonYourInstance-OfflineInstallation), or from the commandline using `nuxeoctl mp-install`.

We also plan to eventually make it available from the "Package from Nuxeo Marketplace" tab.

## Important Note

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
