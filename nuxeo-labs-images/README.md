# nuxeo-labs-images
A project to manage Image manipulation through automation or action(s).

This package contains:
* [Converters](#converters)
  * A generic converter using ImageMagick
  * Specific opÃªrations, which use the generic converter: Watermark, Crop, ...
* [A "Crop" Toolbar Button](#crop-toolbar-button), which displays a dialog letting the user to crop the picture embedded in the current document.

# Using the plugin

* **General Information**

  As of today, each picture operation uses **ImageMagick** to perform its task. Which means ImageMagick must be installed on the server. That said, it is likely already installed, since it is used by nuxeo (thumbnail generation for example.)

* **Converters**
  * The project creates new operations that can be declared in Nuxeo Studio, so they are available in the list of operations in the Automation Chains.
  * To declare the operations in Studio, just add their JSON definition in the "Automation Operations" registry (see [this documentation](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/Studio/Referencing+an+Externally+Defined+Operation)).
* **Crop Toolbar Button**
  * Automatically displayed when the current document has an image
  * If you don't want to display this button, you can just add an XML extension in you project (see below)



# Converters

All the operations are istalled in the `Conversion` topic. Every conversion operation uses the `GenericConverter`. This `GenericConverter`itself can be easily extended via XML declarations, so you can add your own converters using ImageMagick without the need to write a Java plug-in. All other operaitons are mainly helpers, to make it easier to watermark, crop, or convert an image.

Also, each operation is documented: In Studio, when you select the operation, it gives details about its parameters.

* **Common parameters**. Some operations use the `targetFileName` and `targetFileNameSuffix` parameters. Here is how to use them:
  * If `targetFileName` is not provided, the output blob filename will be the same as input blob (possibly with another extension - in case of format change for example).
  * f `targetFileSuffix` is used, it will be added to the target file name, *before* the extension. So, for example, if the destination file name is `mypict.jpg` and the suffix is `-copy`, the target file name will be `mypict-copy.jpg`.

* **`Conversion > Image: Change Format`** (operation ID `ImageChangeFormat`)

  Receives a `blob` (picture binary) as input, converts it to another format (`format` parameter), and returns the converted `blob`. See [ImageMagick documentation](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php) to check the available formats

* **`Conversion > Image: Crop`** (operation ID `ImageCrop`)
  * Receives a `blob` (picture binary) as input, crops it using the parameters, returns the cropped `blob`
  * Parameters:
    * `top`, `left`, `widht`, `height` define the position and size of the crop
      * *Notice*: If `width` or `height` is 0, nothing is done, the input blob is returned unchanged
    * `pictureWidth` and `pictureHeight` are the size (in pixels) of the picture used for cropping. The coordinates of the crop will be scaled to fit the original picture size. So for example,
      * If...
        * The original picture is 4000x2000,
        * The picture used for cropping (the input blob) is 1000x500 (4 time smaller),
        * And the crop is 10, 10, 200, 200
      * ... then the final crop on the original picture will be 40, 40, 800, 800, so there will be no changes for the user.

* **`Conversion > Image: Crop and Save in Document`** (operation ID `ImageCropInDocument`)
  * Receives a Document as input. Gets it's main file (`file:content`) and crops it (see `ImageCrop`)
  * The cropped image becomes the new main file of the Document.
  * The optionnal `incrementVersion` parameter makes it possible to increment the version of the document *before* replacing the main file.
  
* **`Conversion > Image: Watermark with Text`** (operation ID `ImageWatermarkWithText`)
  * Receives a `blob` (picture binary) as input, adds the watermark using the parameters, returns the watermarked `blob`.
  * There are many parameters, all optionnal but the `textValue`:
    * `textValue`
    * `gravity`: Default value `SouthWest`
    * `textColor`: Default value `Red`
    * `textSize`: Default value `24`
    * `strokeColor`: Default value `#A84100`
    * `strokeWidth`: Default value `1`
    * `textRotation`: Default value `0`
    * `xOffset`: Default value `0`
    * `yOffset`: Default value `0`

* **`Conversion > GenericConverter`**
  * As its name states, this converter is generic. Which means that you must tell it what converter to use, and which parameters to inject
  * The parameters are:
    * `converterName`: The exact name (case sensitive) as the one you declared in Studio or of one of the converters provoided by this plug-in
    * `parameters`: The parameters of the command line to pass to the operation (the command line can be found in the declaration of the converters)
  * Have a look at `/main+resources/OSGI-INF/extensions/conversions.xml`. Basically, you must:
    1. Declare a `converter` using a `commandLine`
    2. Declare this `CommandLine`, where you use parameters that will be passed to the command line
  * So in Studio, you can declare a [new XML Extension](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Contributing+to+an+Extension+Using+Nuxeo+Studio) and fill it with your converter and your command line. Important point is to use the `org.nuxeo.labs.images.GenericImageMagickConverter` in your converter:
  ```
<!-- Declare the "MyConverter" converter which uses the "MyCommandLine" command line -->
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.convert.service.ConversionServiceImpl"
  point="converter">
  <converter name="MyConverter" class="org.nuxeo.labs.images.GenericImageMagickConverter">
    <parameters>
      <parameter name="CommandLineName">MyCommandLine</parameter>
    </parameters>
  </converter>
</extension>
<!-- Declare the MyCommandLine command line -->
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.commandline.executor.service.CommandLineExecutorComponent"
  point="command">
  <command name="MyCommandLine" enabled="true">
    <!-- The Command to use. Here, we use "convert", form ImageMagick -->
    <commandLine>convert</commandLine>
    <!-- The parameters to pass to the command line.
         Here, we use the conversion, from jpg to png for example
         The expected parameter is the format -->
    <parameterString>#{sourceFilePath} #{targetFilePath}.#{theFormat}</parameterString>
    <!-- This one is good habit. So server.log will let you know you have a problem
         if ImageMagick is not avilable -->
    <installationDirective>You need to install ImageMagick.</installationDirective>
  </command>
</extension>
  ```
    * Now, you can use the `Conversion > GenericConverter` operation with the following parameters:
      * `converterName`: `MyConverter`
      * `parameters`: `theFormat=png`
    * **IMPORTANT**: The names of the `sourceFilePath` and `targetFilePath` must not be modified, these names are hard-coded in the converter.
        * `sourceFilePath` is provided by the converter (using the input blob), so you don't have to handle it. Don't use it in the parameters
        * `targetFilePath` is misnamed. It actually should be "targetFileName, because it must be filled with the name of the resulting file, including the extension.

# Crop Toolbar Button

This button displays a "Crop" button in the toolbar for documents having the `Picture` facet. A dialog lets the user to crop the picture using a selection rectangle and the cropped image replaces the existing one.

*Note*: The action declares a `filter` so it will not be displayed if the user does not have *write* access to the document, or if the document cannot be modified (it is a verison for example).

If you don't want to display this button, you can disable it by adding the following [XML Extension](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Contributing+to+an+Extension+Using+Nuxeo+Studio):

```
<require>org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.actions</require>
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.actions.ActionService"
    point="actions">
  <action id="cropImageAction" enabled="false" />
</extension>
```


# Third Party Tools Used
 * **Jcrop**<br/>
  Jcrop (http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html) is used in the User Interface for cropping an image

# Notes
This project needs ImageMagick to work

This project is not unit-tested, please use with care
